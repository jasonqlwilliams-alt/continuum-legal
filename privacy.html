<h1>Continuum Orchestrator — Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><em>Last updated: February 22, 2026</em></p>

<h2>What This Service Does</h2>
<p>Continuum is a personal productivity orchestrator operated by Jason Williams. It sends SMS notifications to the account owner for time-sensitive alerts such as task reminders, system health warnings, and advisory messages.</p>

<h2>Data Collection</h2>
<p>The only personal data processed for SMS delivery is the account owner's phone number, which is stored in a private server environment variable. No phone numbers are collected from end users or third parties.</p>

<h2>Data Usage</h2>
<p>Phone numbers are used exclusively for sending operational SMS notifications from the Continuum system to the account owner. Messages are transactional and relate to system alerts, task management, and personal productivity advisories.</p>

<h2>Third-Party Sharing</h2>
<p>Phone numbers and message content are not shared with third parties, sold, or used for marketing purposes. Twilio is used as the SMS delivery provider and processes messages in accordance with their own privacy policy.</p>

<h2>Data Retention</h2>
<p>SMS message logs are retained by Twilio per their standard retention policy. No SMS content is stored locally beyond transient server logs.</p>

<h2>Opt-Out</h2>
<p>The account owner may disable SMS notifications at any time by removing the Twilio configuration from the server environment or replying STOP to any message.</p>

<h2>Contact</h2>
<p>For questions about this policy, contact the operator at the email address associated with the Twilio account.</p>
